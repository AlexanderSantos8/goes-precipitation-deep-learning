# Overview

This project develops an end-to-end meteorological data processing framework designed to prepare high-resolution satellite, lightning, and radar observations for neural network-based precipitation estimation.

The framework integrates multiple NOAA atmospheric observation systems:

- **Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-R) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI)**
- **Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM)**
- **Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor (MRMS) precipitation products**

The primary objective is to transform raw meteorological observations into structured, spatially aligned datasets suitable for deep learning architectures, including:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- ConvLSTM precipitation forecasting models

# Research Objectives

Extreme precipitation events create significant challenges for:

- Flood prediction
- Severe weather monitoring
- Agricultural planning
- Emergency response systems

This project establishes a preprocessing framework capable of:

1. Acquiring large-scale meteorological datasets
2. Processing satellite and radar observations
3. Performing spatial coordinate transformations
4. Aligning multiple atmospheric sensors
5. Generating machine-learning-ready datasets

# Data Sources

## GOES-R Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI)

The ABI instrument provides multispectral observations across 16 spectral channels.

This project utilizes five infrared channels:

| Channel | Wavelength | Application |
|---|---|---|
| Channel 8 | 6.2 μm | Upper-level water vapor analysis |
| Channel 10 | 7.3 μm | Lower-level atmospheric moisture |
| Channel 11 | 8.4 μm | Cloud-top phase detection |
| Channel 14 | 11.2 μm | Cloud-top and surface temperature |
| Channel 15 | 12.3 μm | Moisture correction and atmospheric characterization |

These measurements provide information about:

- Cloud structure
- Atmospheric moisture
- Cloud-top temperature
- Convective development

# Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM)

The GLM instrument provides continuous lightning observations across the Western Hemisphere.

Lightning detections were extracted as spatial coordinates and projected onto satellite grids to analyze relationships between:

- Lightning density
- Convective storm development
- Heavy precipitation events

---

# Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor (MRMS)

MRMS integrates observations from:

- Ground-based radar networks
- Satellites
- Surface gauge measurements

to generate high-resolution Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPE).

MRMS precipitation products serve as the reference target variable for future neural network training.
